# ``A`` and ``beta`` describe the latent power spectrum ``P(w) = A * w**-beta``;
# ``delta_optimal`` mode turns ``P`` at the coarse grid's Nyquist frequency into
# the transition time via Eq. 9. ``flux`` and ``wan21`` are the fits shipped by
# the official repo.
#
# The remaining presets are *calibrated*, not measured: ``beta`` is taken from
# the measured fit for the same VAE latent space, and ``A`` is then solved so
# that the default ``delta=0.01`` with ``scales=0.5,1.0`` at 1024x1024 places
# the transition at a target sigma chosen from the model's step budget. Each
# entry below records that target; ``tests/test_math.py`` re-derives it.

# ``flux`` and ``flux2`` are calibrated from A/B output, and **``flux`` no
# longer ships the published fit** (A 203.615097, beta 1.915461, sigma* 0.8527
# -- restorable via the ``custom`` preset). The measurement that moved it: on
# Flux.1 dev at 1024x1024, transitioning at sigma 0.9389 renders license-plate
# text as wrong letters, while 0.9611 renders it correctly. The published
# threshold of 0.8527 is far below both.
#
# What made this findable is that the quality boundary is a *sigma*, and it
# holds across models, resolutions and schedules that differ by 7.6x:
#
#   FLUX.2 1536px  15/40 coarse  sigma 0.9915  indistinguishable from off
#   Flux.1 1536px  15/40 coarse  sigma 0.9915  text fine
#   Flux.1 1024px  12/40 coarse  sigma 0.9611  text correct
#   Flux.1 1024px  15/40 coarse  sigma 0.9389  text broken
#   FLUX.2 1536px  29/40 coarse  sigma 0.9362  sharp, small details missing
#   FLUX.2 1536px  33/40 coarse  sigma 0.8628  coherent but visibly simpler
#   FLUX.2 1536px  35/40 coarse  sigma 0.7762  broken
#
# Everything at sigma >= 0.96 passes. Note the step counts do *not* transfer --
# Flux.1 needed 28 full-resolution steps at 1024px but only 25 at 1536px,
# because fine detail lands on more pixels as the canvas grows. Only the sigma
# is invariant, which is why the threshold rather than the step budget is what
# these presets pin. 0.968 is the anchor: it reproduces both measured optima
# (11-12 of 40 coarse at 1024px, 25 of 40 at 1536px).
#
# A consequence worth knowing: under a fixed sigma threshold SPEED's payoff
# *grows* with resolution, because a larger canvas runs a more compressed
# schedule and so puts more steps above the threshold. Measured with ``flux``
# at 40 steps: ~1.15x at 1024px on a stock schedule, ~1.9x at 1536px.
#
# The other four are untouched pending their own A/B and keep both the
# spectrum-derived threshold and the step-fraction cap that compensates for it.
#
# Why the Krea-2 presets are not just ``wan21``: Krea 2 encodes with the
# Qwen-Image VAE, whose latent format (16ch, 8x, same per-channel mean/std) is
# the Wan 2.1 one, so ``beta`` carries over — but the ``wan21`` amplitude was
# fitted on low-resolution video latents and puts the transition at sigma 0.69,
# which on Krea 2's schedule spends 5 of 8 Turbo steps at half resolution. A
# 1024px still holds far more high-frequency latent energy than a 480p video
# frame, so a larger ``A`` (earlier activation) is the physically expected
# direction as well as the empirically better one.
#
# Krea 2 also runs a strongly shifted schedule (mu=1.15, i.e. an effective
# shift of exp(1.15)=3.158 at every resolution; some ComfyUI workflows raise it
# to 1.5 -> 4.48), which holds sigma near 1.0 for the first third of the run.
# A threshold that reads as "early" therefore lands mid-schedule: at 8 steps,
# sigma* 0.90 leaves 5 of 8 steps at full resolution, and 0.8527 (the ``flux``
# preset) leaves 4-5 depending on the scheduler.
#
# Z-Image shares the Flux VAE latent space, so ``beta`` is Flux's; only the
# amplitude is re-calibrated, because Z-Image Turbo runs 8-9 steps on a much
# stronger shift (3.0 in ComfyUI, 9.0 in the Forge Neo preset) and the ``flux``
# threshold leaves as few as 2 full-resolution steps at shift 9. sigma* 0.94
# keeps at least 5 of 9 steps at full resolution across that whole shift range.
#
# ``flux2`` is the weakest-founded entry here and is flagged as such: there is
# no measured (A, beta) fit for FLUX.2's VAE anywhere this repo has access to,
# and unlike Krea 2 it is not a byte-identical match to an existing fit --
# FLUX.2's latent is 32 real channels at 16x spatial compression (packed into
# a 128-channel/8x tensor; see ``latent_rgb_factors_reshape`` in ComfyUI's
# ``latent_formats.py``), not the 16ch/8x of Flux.1's. ``beta`` is Flux.1's,
# on no stronger basis than "closest available analog, same lineage" -- take
# it as a starting point to refine with ``custom``, not a calibrated value.
# What *is* source-backed: FLUX.2 Klein 4B/9B both declare ``shift = 2.02``
# (ComfyUI ``supported_models.py``, log-space mu like Flux.1/Krea 2, i.e. an
# effective multiplier of exp(2.02) = 7.54 -- much stronger than Flux.1's
# default 1.15). No separate entry exists for the 32B "dev" checkpoint at
# this writing; Klein's value is assumed to carry over since all FLUX.2
# variants share the same VAE. That shift crowds sigma near 1.0 hard: at 40-50
# steps even sigma* 0.90 -- deliberately the least aggressive target in this
# table -- lands the transition close to the schedule's midpoint.
#
# ``anima`` (circlestone-labs/Anima) is a Cosmos-Predict2-class DiT --
# ``CosmosTransformer3DModel``, 28 blocks at 2048 channels, ``patch_spatial=2``
# -- re-textencoded onto Qwen3-0.6B. Its three numbers are better founded than
# ``flux2``'s, all read from the shipped config rather than inferred from
# lineage:
#
#   * ``beta`` is the Wan 2.1 fit, on the same basis as ``krea-2`` but confirmed
#     directly: the VAE is ``AutoencoderKLQwenImage`` (``z_dim`` 16,
#     ``dim_mult [1,2,4,4]`` -> 8x spatial) and its ``latents_mean`` /
#     ``latents_std`` are byte-identical to Wan 2.1's.
#   * ``ref_latent`` is 128, *not* 64, despite ``patch_spatial=2``. Anima's 2x2
#     packing happens inside the DiT's ``x_embedder``, downstream of the
#     sampler, so SPEED still sees a 128x128 grid at 1024x1024. FLUX.2 is the
#     opposite case -- there the packing is in the latent format itself, so the
#     sampler-visible grid really is halved. Same patch size, different answer;
#     what matters is which side of the sampler it happens on.
#   * ``ref_shift`` is 3.0 as a **raw multiplier**, not ``exp(mu)``. Anima is a
#     ``PredictionDiscreteFlow`` model (``time_snr_shift``), so it takes the
#     ``z-image`` / ``wan21`` units, not the ``flux`` / ``krea-2`` ones. See
#     knowledge_sigmas.md 5.4.
#
# sigma* 0.9600 is picked from where the Forge Neo default path lands rather
# than from the step budget alone. Anima's Forge Neo preset is 32 steps, Beta,
# ER SDE, CFG 4.0 at shift 3.0, and the webui defaults to ``neo_shift`` with a
# 1.03 divisor -- so the threshold that actually gets used is 0.9600/1.03 =
# 0.9320, clearing the 0.9249 quality floor the live binary search found on this
# backend (see ``sigma_divisor`` below) with margin. Ship it at 1.0 divisor and
# it is more conservative still. Untested on Anima itself: 0.9249 was measured
# on Flux.1, and only the *schedule family* carries over, not the model.
#
# Two things follow from Anima declaring ``use_dynamic_shifting: false``, which
# no other preset here does. First, its schedule shift is flat on **every**
# backend, not just Forge Neo -- so the payoff does not grow with canvas size
# the way ``flux``'s does (~1.15x at 1024 to ~1.9x at 1536); expect roughly the
# same ratio at every resolution with adaptive delta on. Second, the
# step-fraction cap has no schedule compression left to compensate for, so its
# only effect here is to trim: ``reference_coarse_fraction`` inverts a
# *uniform-in-t* schedule, Anima's default scheduler is Beta(0.6,0.6) which
# clusters steps at both ends of the range, and at 32 steps the cap holds the
# transition about 3 steps earlier than the threshold's own crossing. That
# divergence is not new -- it costs krea-2 one step at 20 and krea-2-raw one to
# two at 40-50 -- but Anima is the first spectrum-derived preset with a large
# default step budget, so it is the first place the gap is worth naming. If A/B
# shows the threshold is right and the cap is what is costing speed, the fix is
# to promote the preset to measured and drop ``ref_shift`` (checklist step 3 in
# knowledge_speed.md 10), not to loosen the cap for everyone.
#
# Verified against a synthetic Forge Neo schedule (the method in
# knowledge_speed.md 6: PredictionDiscreteFlow sigma table at shift 3.0, Beta
# (0.6,0.6) spacing, ``scales=0.5,1.0``, divisor 1.03, adaptive on):
#
#   preset  1024px      1536px      transition sigma   approx speedup
#   flux     8/32 coarse  8/32 coarse  0.9335           1.23x
#   anima    6/32 coarse  6/32 coarse  0.9600           1.16x
#
# Two things to read off that. First, both are flat across resolution, which is
# the ``use_dynamic_shifting: false`` consequence above showing up in practice
# -- do not expect the README's 1.15x->1.9x curve here. Second, **this preset is
# currently slower than running Anima on ``flux``**, which is what it replaces.
# That is entirely the cap: with adaptive off, ``anima`` gives 9/32 at 1024px
# against ``flux``'s 8/32, so the threshold really is the more aggressive of the
# two, and the cap then drags it back to 6. Shipping conservative is the right
# default for an untested preset, but if A/B clears sigma 0.9182 (the 9/32
# crossing) then dropping ``ref_shift`` is the change that pays -- it also
# restores resolution scaling, 11/32 at 1536px and 13/32 at 2048px.
#
# ``delta`` remains the speed/quality slider on top of a preset. For ``krea-2``
# it spans sigma* 0.93 (delta=0.005) to 0.80 (delta=0.05); smaller delta means
# an earlier transition, higher quality and less speedup.
#
# ``ref_latent`` is the latent short side the preset's sigma* is calibrated at,
# i.e. what a 1024x1024 generation looks like on that model's VAE grid. It is
# 128 for the 8x-compression VAEs (Flux, Wan 2.1 / Qwen-Image, Z-Image) and 64
# for FLUX.2, whose sampler-visible latent is 128 channels at 1/16 scale: its
# VAE encodes at 8x into 32 channels and then packs 2x2 spatially into the
# channel axis (``AutoencoderKLFlux2.encode``, ``patch_size: [2, 2]``), so a
# 1024px image is a 64x64 grid, not 128x128. ``adaptive_delta`` uses this to
# hold the coarse/detail step split steady across resolutions -- see
# ``_resolve_transitions``.
# =============================================================================

# Latent short side of the reference case every preset's sigma* is quoted at
# (1024x1024 on an 8x-compression VAE). Also the ``adaptive_delta`` fallback
# for ``custom``, where the model -- and so its compression -- is unknown.
REFERENCE_LATENT = 128

# Degeneration backstop, not a budget target: the coarse segments may not
# consume more than this fraction of the schedule. It exists only so an
# extreme schedule cannot starve the full-resolution pass to nothing -- at 40
# steps it guarantees 8 full-resolution steps, and measured output only breaks
# below about 6. It is deliberately loose enough never to fire on a
# configuration anyone runs; a *calibrated* sigma threshold is what actually
# decides the split. Applies to presets with no ``ref_shift`` (see below).
MAX_COARSE_FRACTION = 0.8

# ``ref_shift`` is the model's own effective schedule multiplier at the
# reference resolution, and its units differ by predictor family: it is
# ``exp(mu)`` for the ``PredictionFlux`` models (Flux's mu 1.15 -> 3.158,
# FLUX.2's 2.02 -> 7.538) and the raw multiplier for the
# ``PredictionDiscreteFlow`` ones (Z-Image 3.0, Wan 2.1 8.0). Mixing the two
# up is the trap documented in knowledge_sigmas.md 5.4. It converts the
# reference transition sigma into a reference *step fraction*, which
# ``_resolve_transitions`` then holds.
#
# **A preset that carries no ``ref_shift`` has been calibrated against measured
# output and does not want that step-fraction cap** -- its sigma is already the
# right answer, and capping the share would override it (for ``flux`` the cap
# would demand 5 of 40 steps where the measured-correct answer is 11). ``flux``
# and ``flux2`` are in that state; the rest still run the spectrum-derived
# threshold and keep the cap that compensates for it.
#
# ``sigma_divisor`` (``_resolve_transitions``, ``sample_speed_core``) is a
# different kind of correction from either of the above: not a per-preset
# constant, but a per-*backend* one. The measured sigma anchor (0.9680) was
# calibrated where the effective schedule shift grows with resolution
# (ComfyUI's ``ModelSamplingFlux`` / SwarmUI's Sigma Shift). Forge Neo runs
# Flux and FLUX.2 at a flat `mu=1.15` regardless of canvas size -- there is no
# user-facing Shift control for those models in that webui -- so the same
# sigma threshold crosses far earlier in step-count terms there than on a
# backend that does shift. A live binary search on Forge Neo (Euler/Beta,
# 1024x1024, seed 42, both 20 and 40 total steps) found the true quality floor
# at sigma ~0.9249, not 0.968, and reproduced it at both step counts once the
# schedule (shift + spacing) was held fixed -- confirming sigma is still the
# invariant *within one schedule family*, just not transferable across a
# schedule-shift change. ``sigma_divisor`` lets the ``neo_shift`` Forge Neo UI
# mode apply that backend-specific correction directly, without touching the
# shared calibration every other consumer (the ComfyUI node, SwarmUI) relies
# on. See ``scripts/speed_forge.py`` for where it's exposed, and the README's
# "neo_shift mode" section for the measurement.

    """Return ``(step_idx, s_i, s_next)`` transitions from ``scales`` and ``delta``.

    With ``adaptive`` set, the transition timing is held at what it would be for
    a ``ref_latent``-sized latent instead of tracking the actual one.

    Why that is wanted: Eq. 10 evaluates the spectrum at the *coarse grid's own
    Nyquist frequency* in latent pixels, so the same preset and delta transition
    progressively later as the canvas grows -- for ``flux`` at 40 steps, 16 of
    40 steps coarse at 1024x1024 but 22 of 40 at 2048x2048. That is Eq. 10
    working correctly (a bigger canvas really does keep its high-frequency band
    noise-dominated for longer), but it inverts the point of the extension: the
    coarse pass only lays down composition, and giving it a *larger* share of
    the schedule at high resolution buys nothing while starving the detail
    pass. Adaptive removes the resolution term so the coarse/detail split stays
    where the preset was calibrated, with no per-resolution retuning.

    The threshold is pinned as ``t* = max(t*_reference, t*_actual)``. That
    removes the resolution term while staying one-directional: below the
    reference resolution the actual threshold is already the earlier
    (higher-sigma, more conservative) one and is kept, so adaptive is a no-op
    there rather than making small canvases more aggressive -- at 512x512 a 0.5
    first scale is a 256px coarse pass, marginal already.

    For a preset with a *measured* sigma (no ``ref_shift``) that is the whole
    mechanism, and it is enough: a sigma is invariant across schedules, so the
    step split it produces adapts on its own. Only ``MAX_COARSE_FRACTION``
    remains, as a backstop against degeneration rather than a budget.

    For a preset still on the spectrum-derived threshold (``ref_shift`` set),
    the sigma alone lands too late once the schedule is compressed -- ComfyUI's
    ``ModelSamplingFlux`` and SwarmUI's Sigma Shift derive mu from width*height,
    and a FLUX.2-class schedule at 1536x1536 holds sigma above 0.93 for 30 of 40
    steps. Those presets additionally hold the coarse *share* at
    ``ceil(n * reference_coarse_fraction(t*, ref_shift))``, the share the
    reference case spends coarse, which tracks the preset and ``delta``. Without
    it such a run gives 33/40 coarse, and at 3072x3072 the transition never
    fires at all and the output stays half-resolution.

    ``sigma_divisor`` is applied last, after adaptive pinning, to every
    resolved ``t_star`` alike -- a backend-level correction rather than a
    per-preset one. It exists for Forge Neo's ``neo_shift`` mode, where the
    model runs at a schedule shift that does not track resolution (see the
    ``_PRESETS`` comment block), so the shared sigma anchor lands more
    conservatively there than on a backend that does shift. ``1.0`` is an
    exact no-op -- dividing by 1.0 changes nothing, so this is mathematically
    identical to plain ``delta_optimal``. Values above 1.0 lower the
    threshold (transition later, more coarse steps, more speed); values below
    1.0 raise it (transition earlier, fewer coarse steps, more conservative).
